## Project Structure

1. **Adaptee**: defines incompatible interface that need to be integrated.
2. **Adapter**: The integration class that enables the incompatible interface to work with the current interface.
3. **Target**: An interface containing functionalities used by the Client.
4. **Client**: The class that uses objects with the Target interface.
